## Pre-Requisites

- [ ] Powershell or Bash installed locally
- [ ] Visual Studio Code
- [ ] An Azure Subscription with Owner Permissions
- [ ] Install Terraform CLI
- [ ] Clone the Repository to your Local Machine
- [ ] Create an Azure Service Principal
```
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "TerraformServicePrincipal" --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --output json
```
- [ ] Copy the output of the above command and save it in a secure location. The output will look like this:
```json
{
  "appId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "displayName": "TerraformServicePrincipal",
  "name": "http://TerraformServicePrincipal",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "tenant": "YOUR_TENANT_ID"
}
```
- [ ] Install Azure CLI
```
log in to CLI: az login --service-principal --username APP_ID --password CLIENT_SECRET --tenant TENANT_ID

# set azure subscription
az account set <subscription_id>

#confirm subscription
az account show --output table
```

- [ ] Assign the Service Principal with Contributor role to the subscription
- [ ] Export the following Environment Variables for Terraform to run locally using the Service Principal against your Azure Subscription

- Bash:
```
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
export ARM_TENANT_ID=<YOUR_TENANT_ID>
export ARM_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
```

- PowerShell:
```
$env:ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
$env:ARM_TENANT_ID="<YOUR_TENANT_ID>"
$env:ARM_CLIENT_ID="<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>"
$env:ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>"
```

## Lab 1: Run Terraform Locally and create resources in Azure

1) Make sure you are in the scripts directory. Run a ```terraform init``` command to initialize the Terraform working directory. This command downloads the necessary provider plugins and sets up the backend configuration.

Note how a .terraform directory is created in the scripts directory. This is where terraform stores the provider plugins and other necessary files.

2) Next let's run a terraform plan to see what will happen if our code were to be applied to an Azure Subscription.

**Important** Ensure you are in the ```scripts``` folder when running this command otherwise it will not pick up your tfvars files.

```
terraform plan -var-file=../config/dev-poc/applicationinsights.auto.tfvars  -var-file=../config/dev-poc/appserviceplan.auto.tfvars -var-file=../config/dev-poc/parameters.auto.tfvars -var-file=../config/dev-poc/resourcegroups.auto.tfvars -out=tfplan
```

3) Review the output of the terraform plan command. Your output should look very similar to this:

```
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # azurerm_service_plan.example will be created
  + resource "azurerm_service_plan" "example" {
      + id                           = (known after apply)
      + kind                         = (known after apply)
      + location                     = "westeurope"
      + maximum_elastic_worker_count = (known after apply)
      + name                         = "asptoday1234-dev"
      + os_type                      = "Linux"
      + per_site_scaling_enabled     = false
      + reserved                     = (known after apply)

      + sku_name                     = "F1"
      + worker_count                 = (known after apply)
    }

  # module.app_insights.data.azurerm_resource_group.this will be read during apply
  # (depends on a resource or a module with changes pending)
 <= data "azurerm_resource_group" "this" {
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + location = (known after apply)
      + name     = "asp-dev-rg"
      + tags     = (known after apply)
    }

  # module.app_insights.azurerm_application_insights.this["appinsight1"] will be created
  + resource "azurerm_application_insights" "this" {
      + app_id                                = (known after apply)
      + application_type                      = "web"

      + daily_data_cap_notifications_disabled = (known after apply)
      + disable_ip_masking                    = false
      + force_customer_storage_for_profiler   = false
      + id                                    = (known after apply)
      + instrumentation_key                   = (sensitive value)
      + internet_ingestion_enabled            = true
      + internet_query_enabled                = true
      + local_authentication_disabled         = false
      + location                              = (known after apply)
      + name                                  = "application-insights-dev"
      + resource_group_name                   = "asp-dev-rg"
      + retention_in_days                     = 60
      + sampling_percentage                   = 100
      + tags                                  = (known after apply)
    }

  # module.resource_groups.azurerm_resource_group.this["resource_group_1"] will be created
  + resource "azurerm_resource_group" "this" {
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + location = "westeurope"
      + name     = "asp-dev-rg"
      + tags     = {
          + "app_id"     = "00000"
          + "contact_dl" = "codycarlson@microsoft.com"
          + "created_by" = "codycarlson"
        }
    }

Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + application_insights = (sensitive value)
  + resource_groups      = {
      + resource_group_ids_map       = {
          + asp-dev-rg = (known after apply)
        }
      + resource_group_locations_map = {
          + asp-dev-rg = "westeurope"
        }
      + resource_group_tags_map      = {
          + asp-dev-rg = {
              + "app_id"     = "00000"
              + "contact_dl" = "codycarlson@microsoft.com"
              + "created_by" = "codycarlson"
            }
        }
    }
```

4) After reviewing the tfplan output and ensure it matches desired configuration changes, run the command ```terraform apply tfplan``` from the scripts folder to apply the changes created by the previous tfplan

5) Confirm successful run and verify changes in your Azure Portal
